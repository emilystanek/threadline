# threadline 📖

A React Native / Expo app for spoiler-free e-book reading.

**Requirements**
- Node.js (16+ recommended)
- Yarn or npm
- Expo CLI (optional but convenient)

**Quick start**

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
# yarn install
```

Run the app (Expo):

```bash
npm run start
# or
npm run android
# or
npm run ios
# or
npm run web
```

This project uses the scripts defined in `package.json` (Expo):

- `start`: launch Expo dev tools
- `android`: open on Android device/emulator
- `ios`: open on iOS simulator/device
- `web`: run in the browser via `react-native-web`

**Notes**
- The project is configured for Expo (see `expo` dependency in `package.json`).
- TypeScript is used; run-time type checking is not included — use your editor's TypeScript support.

**License**
- Add a license file if you plan to open-source this repository.
